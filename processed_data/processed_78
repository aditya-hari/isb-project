Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities - we're just getting started.

Summary

The FRL (Facebook Reality Labs) Wireless Platforms Hardware Team focuses on delivering Facebook's mission through a series of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) products. The team is driving the state-of-the-art forward with breakthrough work in computer vision, machine learning, mixed reality, graphics, displays, sensors, and new ways to map the human body. Our systems will enable AR/VR devices where our real and virtual world will mix and match throughput the day. We believe the only way to achieve the goals is to look at the entire stack, from transistor, through architecture, to algorithm, protocol, and firmware implementation. Wireless communication is one of the key enabling technologies.We are seeking an experienced Wireless Systems Engineer, with a focus on standards to represent Facebook Inc.'s interest and strategy in various wireless networking standards bodies, with focus on WLAN and WPAN. You will be working with our FRL product teams to define/shape end-to-end wireless networking solutions, and work in the standards bodies to enable wider adoption of solutions via protocol standardization, as well as increasing interoperability.This is a full-time position, with significant travel requirements to international standards meetings as well as to other national and international Facebook sites.

Required Skills

* Participate in IEEE 802 WLAN/WPAN standardization and associated industry interoperability/specification programs (e.g. WFA)
* Conduct protocol performance analysis and evaluate wireless solutions for AR/VR products. Define requirements, identify technical gaps, and create novel solutions for existing and future products
* Define standards strategy and develop solutions for wireless communication technology

Minimum Qualification

* MS or PhD in Electrical or Computer Science or equivalent work experience
* 10+ years experience in wireless (WiFi/BT) system and protocol experience
* Knowledgeable in the IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi protocol family including 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax and various WFA protocol specifications, e.g. P2P/NAN
* Experience with the IEEE 802.15 protocol family and/or protocols based on them
* Experience in data path flow, and realistic constraints such as memory and power consumption
* Experience in wireless standards (including IEEE 802.11ax and 802.11be) and WFA procedures, and have proven track record in effective contributions and technical initiatives
* Communication skills and documentation skills in communicating ideas, developing and collaborating on standards contributions
* Understanding of wireless network system architecture and protocol design, including hands-on industrial experience
* Software programming skills: C/C++, scripting (e.g. Python), MATLAB

Preferred Qualification

* Experience with broader wireless technologies and standards, including 802.15, WiGig (11ad, 11ay), Bluetooth, and cellular LTE/5G, in addition to 802.11
* Experience with MAC/PHY/RF design and silicon constraints
* Knowledge in network stack beyond layer-2, and core network architecture
* Experience in analyzing and designing coexistence policy and mechanisms of various wireless technologies
* Ns-3 simulation knowledge or work experience
